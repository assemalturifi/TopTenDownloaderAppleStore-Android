# TopTenDownloaderAppleStore-Android
in this app i retrieved apple xml file for the top 10%25 most downloaded apps. In this app you can select top 10 or 25 to see the top downladed apps and when you rotate the device all the instances are saved.
I created my own adapter class.Also I retrieved the xml data using asynTask doing it in the background so there would be no interraption while the app is being used.
and created my own accustomed class to parse the xml into the app.
